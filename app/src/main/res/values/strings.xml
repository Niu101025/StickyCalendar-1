	<string name="rationale">Why this app?\nThis is because Google Calendar Notification would only stay for about an hour and then they disappear.\nNot everyone likes this behavior.\n\nHow it works?\nThis app would catch all notifications from Google Calendar and will replace them with identical notifications that would open the same event when clicked</string>

	<string name="rationale2">Why reminders are not handled?\nUnfortunately format of the notification is different from regular events and they are less documented\nAt this moment it is safer to don\'t handle them\n\nThere is no need actually - they would stay until marked as \'DONE\'</string>
